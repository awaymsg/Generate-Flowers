# Generate-Flowers

generates flowers by generating meshes in symmetrical fashion of different shapes and sizes. 
they require food and eventually produce seed and die, passing on their traits to their offspring, with some random variation.
there is currently no food generator though, so they all eventually die out after about 2 generations.
also the flowers react to sound, originally intended to be an audio visualizer, then i decided to try to expand it into a genetic algorithm.
this was also written before formal education so code is pretty messy, first time messing with interfaces and abstract classes
